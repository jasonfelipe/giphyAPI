Video Game Character Giphy

First project that has to do with two APIs

Giantbomb video game wikipedia API
Giphy gif image website

Challenges:
CORS errors were fixed by adding a function to my JS.
Giantbomb needed this in order to function. With it fixed I could take their "deck" section of their wikipedia
and add that on to the website.

Some problems are that the giphy search isn't specific enough for video game characters. Example: Metal Gear Solid's "Grey Fox" will not show up.
I tried adding "video game" to the query search along with the name, but it didn't change anything.
